This article provides a walkthrough of patent data fields for those who are completely new to patent analytics or want to understand the workings of patent data a little bit better. A video version of the walkthrough is available [here](https://youtu.be/RDPlIUB0_QE?list=PLsZOGmKUMi56dAuqSEHjVWkxEf3MbXlQG) and the slide deck is available for download in [.pdf](https://github.com/poldham/opensource-patent-analytics/raw/master/C_obtaining_patent_data/understanding_data_fields/patent_data_fields_OM.pdf), [powerpoint](https://github.com/poldham/opensource-patent-analytics/raw/master/C_obtaining_patent_data/understanding_data_fields/patent_data_fields_OM.pptx) and [apple keynote](https://github.com/poldham/opensource-patent-analytics/raw/master/C_obtaining_patent_data/understanding_data_fields/patent_data_fields_OM.key) from [GitHub](https://github.com/poldham/opensource-patent-analytics/tree/master/C_obtaining_patent_data/understanding_data_fields).

###What is a Patent?

A patent can be described in two main ways:

1. As a particular form of intellectual property right.
2. As a type of document.

Understanding the structure of patent documents and data fields is the essential foundation of patent analytics. However, for those who are new to the patent system it is worth highlighting the key features of patents as a form of intellectual property right. 

###As a form of intellectual property right
1. A patent is a temporary grant of an exclusive right to a patentee to prevent others from making, using, offering for sale, or importing, a patented invention without their consent, in a country where a patent is in force.
2. Patent rights are territorial rights - they are only valid in the territory of the country where granted. 
3. Patents are typically granted for a period of 20 years from the filing data of an application but may be opposed or revoked.
5. To be eligible a claimed invention must:
    + Involve patentable subject matter
    + Be new or novel
    + Involve an inventive step
    + Be susceptible to industrial application or useful.

###Patents as a type of document
For patent analytics we need to concentrate on patents as a form of document and to understand:

1. The structure of patent documents and their data fields.
2. The strengths and limitations of different patent databases as a means for obtaining patent data. 

In this article we deal with the basics of patent documents and their data fields. 

###Basic Data Types

When performing patent analysis we are dealing with data of seven different types:

- **Dates** (priority, application and publication dates)
- **Numbers** (priority number, application number, publication number, family members, citations)
- **Names** (Applicants - also known as Assignees - and Inventors)
- **Classification codes** (e.g. International Patent Classification/Cooperative Patent Classification)
- **Text fields** (Title, Abstract, Description, Claims, Sequence data)
- **Images** (Diagrams)
- **Additional Information** (Legal Status, Public Registry etc)

We will walk through each of these fields using a patent application for synthetic genomes from the J. Craig Venter Institute as an example. Each of the titles for the images are hypelinked to their sources to make it easy to explore the data as you go through them. 

###Synthetic Genomes: [Nature News](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v473/n7347/full/473403a.html)

Synthetic biology (and synthetic genomics) began to hit the international headlines with in the late 2000's with the news in 2010 that members of the J. Craig Venter Institute had successfully synthesised the genome of a Mycoides microbe and transplanted the genome into the empty cell of another Mycoides that then booted up. This led to considerable excitement about the creation of artificial life and is part of the story of the growing prominence of synthetic biology. For our purposes it is a quite novel example for walking through patent data fields.

###Synthetic Genomes: [Original Front Page](http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=WO&NR=2008024129A2&KC=A2&FT=D&ND=5&date=20080228&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_EP)

What we see here is the front page of an international [Patent Cooperation Treaty(PCT)](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/) application. The PCT allows applicants to submit a single application for potential consideration in upto 148 other countries that are Parties to the PCT based on decisions made by applicants and examination decisions in individual countries and regions. The front page (or biblio) displays the datafields that are typically used in patent analysis. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/datafields/synthetic_genomes_frontpage_WO.png)

Starting with dates. There are three dates on this application. 

1. The first date is the priority date (6 December 2005) in the Priority Data field (30). This refers to the original (first filing date) for a US application that is the priority (or parent) of all later filings of the same application anywhere else.
2. The second date is the International Filing Date (22) which is 12 months after the priority filing (US60742542).
3. The third date is the International Publication Date (field 43) which is just over 24 months after the international filing date and 3 years from the first filing (priority application). 

For patent analytics the most important dates are the priority date(06.12.2005) and the publication date (28.02.2008). The priority date is important for two reasons. First, in legal terms, it establishes the priority claim of this claimed invention over other claimed inventions submitted in the same period or later [Paris Convention]. Second, in economic analysis the priority date is the date that is closest to the investment in research and development and therefore the most important in economic analysis. However, this information only becomes available when an application is published. That is typically 24 months from the original filing date. As a result this information falls off a cliff the closer we move towards the present day. 

The publication date is important because, like the publication number, it is generally the most accessible in patent databases. However, in this case there is a three year lag between the first filing date and the publication date. For patent analysis this means that counts based on publication date are always displaying trends that are 2 to 3 years after the original activity has taken place. However, because applicants must pay at each stage of the process patent publication data can be useful as an indicator of demand for patent rights in one or more countries. In many cases the publication date will be the only date that is available to map trends. 

We will address other data fields below but for now note the applicant and inventor information including address and other useful information for patent analysis and mapping. Also, note the international patent classification data as an indicator of technology areas expressed through alphanumeric codes (e.g. C07H21/04). We also see text fields (for text mining) in the title and abstract and finally we have an image with information on DNA cassettes forming part of the invention. 

###Database: [Front Page](http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=WO&NR=2008024129A2&KC=A2&FT=D&ND=5&date=20080228&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_EP)

Here we can see the same information in the front page for the record in the espacenet database. espacenet is easily accessible and widely use. Even when using commercial tools it is the fastest way to look up or check information. For a brief overview see these [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsZOGmKUMi55SmfBRlNCSq_ZmxLHz16fO) and the [interactive espacenet assistant](http://application.epo.org/wbt/espacenet/).

In this case we see data in the form that will typically come back from a patent database. Starting with date, we can see that the priority number field contains the priority (first filing) date 20051206 (as YYYYMMDD), linked to the priority document US2005074254P. This is followed by the application number and date and the publication number and date. The publication number as WO2008024129A2 will typically be the number entered to search a database. The
